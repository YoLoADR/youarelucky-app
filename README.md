### Your API Key is not working?

- Make sure you have an [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/account) and a valid API key to use ChatGPT. We don't sell API keys.
- Make sure you have your billing info added in [OpenAI Billing page](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview). Without billing info, your API key will not work.
- The app will connect to the OpenAI API server to check if your API Key is working properly.
